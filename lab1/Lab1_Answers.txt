Edit the document below to fill your answers from the exercises done in lab.
Be sure to include the proper units, such as "1 kOhm", or "200 mV"

1. What voltage was the power supply set for, and what voltage did the
   DMM measure?
        Power supply =  2.58 V
        DMM =  2.579 V


2. What are the values of the resistors?  List the values from smallest to
   largest.
   From the color bands:
	R1 =  180ohms 5% uncertainty
	R2 =  560ohms 5% uncertainty
	R3 =  1000ohms 10% uncertainty
         
   The measured values:
        R1 =  178.56 ohms
        R2 =  554.2 ohms
        R3 =  1000.5 ohms


3. In the circuit with resistors R1 and R2 in series what are the calculated
   voltages across them?
        V1 =  1.218 volts
        V2 =  3.782 volts


4. In the circuit with resistors R1 and R2 in series what are the measured
   voltages across them?
        V1 =  1.218 volts
        V2 =  3.781 volts


5. What are the voltages (or range of voltages) on the switch output when it
   is not pressed and when it is pressed?
        Not pressed =  0-0.3 millivolts
        Pressed =  0.000-0.001 millivolts


6. With resistor R2 added to the circuit, what are the voltages on the switch
   output when it is not pressed and when it is pressed?
        Not pressed =  4.999 volts
        Pressed =  0.58-0.6 millivolts


7. Assuming Vs = 4.0V and a Vled of 2.0V, calculate the current flowing through
   the LED for both resistors.
                Resistance     Current
        R1:     178.56 ohms    11.2 mA
        R3:     1000.5 ohms    2 mA    


8. Fill in the table below with the input voltages to the 74LS04 inverter
   and the resulting output voltage,

   Input voltage        Output voltage
        0.0                   4.433 V
        0.2                   4.432 V
        0.4                   4.432 V
        0.6                   4.428 V
        0.8                   4.342 V
        1.0                   2.841 V
        1.2                   174.8 mV
        1.4                   170.9 mV
        1.6                   163.3 mV
        1.8                   163.1 mV
        2.0                   163.1 mV
        3.0                   163.2 mV
        4.0                   163.2 mV
        5.0                   163.0 mV
